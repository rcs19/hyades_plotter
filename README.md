# Hyades_Plotter

This repository has code for plotting NetCDF output files from Hyades. The plots can either be created in Python/Jupyter (`.py` and `.ipynb` files) or in IDL (`.pro` files).

## Python Script

## IDL Script

Starting IDL from command line on YPI servers (I am using Sausage):
```
$ /opt/york/phys/pkg/Modules/idl/idl71/bin/idl
```
To run the IDL script:
```
IDL> .run ./src/main_idl.pro
```
